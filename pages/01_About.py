    **Overall Theme: Bridging the Tech-Law Divide**

    **Chosen Theme and Statement: Hybrid Working - Mental Health**

    Problem Statement: Fully remote work arrangements during the pandemic has led to many lawyers feeling burnt out. This was in part due to the lack of social interaction and the subsequent feelings of isolation, alongside the blurring of lines between rest and work. How might we then utilise technology to mitigate such risks and help lawyers with their mental health when it comes to hybrid working arrangements?

    For SMU-LIT Hackathon 2023, we have chosen the theme of Hybrid Working, which requires us to ideate an application to support the mental health of lawyers working in hybrid arrangements.

    To address this problem statement, we have come up with *LegalEase*, *TBD*.
    
    **Inspiration**

    TBD

    **What it does**

    TBD

    **How we built it**

    We used Streamlit, HTML and CSS as our front-end for our web application, and utilised the OpenAI API as well as Firebase for our back-end.

    **What makes our solution stand out**

    TBD

    **Some key challenges we faced**

    A key issue that we've faced is the transition from our typical skillset of HTML/CSS/Javascript to Streamlit, as we wanted to fully utilise the OpenAI API for easier facilitation of the back-end. In addition, we were also new to utilising Firebase to store user data for our login system, to track user history of previous queries using our app.

    **Built with**

    `Firebase` `Python` `Streamlit` `HTML` `CSS` `OpenAI API`

    Github repo: TBD
